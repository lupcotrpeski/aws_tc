Step 1: Place the timer.vX-X.py, settings.json, aws_logo_smile.gif and activies.json in a folder of your choice.
Step 2: Edit the timer.sh to point to that folder (if you're on Windows, you'll want a *.bat file instead). Change permissions on the file so it's executable, if necessary.
Step 3: If you don't have Python 3 installed on your machine, edit the timer.sh to call python instead of python3, or alternatively install Python 3. 
	(For Windows, you'll need to install python if you don't already have it). Install Tkinter if necessary.
Step 4: Launch the Timer program by calling the timer.sh (or timer.bat on windows) from the terminal. You will likely get an error saying the Activities file is missing - you can fix that in the next step.
Step 5: Go to the Settings tab in the Timer program and create paths for the output files (files that OBS will read from), and where it can find the activities.json file.
Step 6: Play around with it to make sure it works as expected.
